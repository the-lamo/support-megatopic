This is mostly used for various Discord-related support problems. I made this because I can link this in chats instead of pasting or writing out a long answer (Ex. I'm lazy but you need help with setting up permissions in your server).

# How to setup Permissions within your Discord server
In order to setup permissions within your server, you need the **Manage Permissions** role within your server, be the owner of the server, or Administrator of the server.
First, make sure you're on that server, and click the Options button (The three dots) in the top left of your window. Once you click this, you should be greeted by a dropdown menu. Click on **Server Settings**. Once you do that, a new window should pop up, and on the left side, some tabs. Click on the **Roles** tab. From here, you can click the "+" to add new roles, or modify existing roles from the central menu. However, there's a lot of roles here, so let this help you.
First of all, the "?" icon beside each role should give you a general idea of what the role is, but this should explain it much further.
# **DISPLAY ROLE SEPARATELY FROM ONLINE MEMBERS**
This would be where whoever has this role shows up on the user panel. It's like the difference between being online and offline, but the Online has other categories.
# **ALLOW ANYONE TO @MENTION THIS ROLE**
When you type a message, you can use @(Username) to mention a specific person. However, you can mention roles in the same way. If you want to mention the role Admins, you can use @Admins to mention everyone who has that role.
# **ADMINISTRATOR**
This is the permission your friends will talk about when they want something. This role gives every permission under General, Text and Voice permissions, no matter what the channel's specific Permissions are. *This can be dangerous.*
# **MANAGE SERVER**
This is the permission that let's you change the name of the Discord server and change the region of the Discord server. This could *Potentially* be dangerous. *Not to be confused with Manage Channels.*
# **MANAGE ROLES**
This role let's you change roles beneath your role in the Roles menu. In the Roles menu, you can drag roles up and down to set the *Prvivilege level,* or rank of the role. If Admin is above Moderator, Admin can mess with the permissions of Moderator, and the Moderator role can't do anything about it, even if they have Manage Roles.
# **MANAGE CHANNELS**
With this role, you can move, edit, change permissions of, create, or even delete Channels within the Discord server. *Not to be confused with Manage Server.*
# **KICK MEMBERS**
As the name implies, with this permission, you can kick people that are lower in rank than you on the Roles tab. *Can be dangerous. Rank: See Manage Roles*
# **BAN MEMBERS**
Same thing as Kick Members, but with more authority. Once kicked with this, you aren't coming back very soon. *See Bans*
# **CREATE INSTANT INVITES**
With this role, you can make your own Instant Invites to your server, and these Invites can be specific to a certain channel, and can be set to expire over time.
# **CHANGE NICKNAME**
With this you can change your own Username, but it will be specific to the server you set it on. Useful if you are in hiding from a crime and need an alias.
# **MANAGE NICKNAMES**
Like Change Nickname, but more *Moderator-like.* You can use this permission to change other's Nicknames. Useful if you are trying to find the criminal, but he has an alias, or if somebody has a *naughty nickname.*
# **MANAGE EMOJIS**
With this Permission, you can add, change, or remove Server-specific Emojis. *See Adding Emojis*
# **MANAGE WEBHOOKS**
*Technology-Knowhow recommended!* Webhooks are like mini bots, which can be used to detect things over the internet, such as Updates on GitHub, a new YouTube video being posted, etc. With this Permission, you can create, edit, and remove these Webhooks.
# **READ MESSAGES**
Pretty self-explainitory, you can read messages with this Permission.
# **SEND MESSAGES**
Yet again, you can send messages with this Permission. Useful for setting up a Welcome Channel.
# **SEND TTS MESSAGES**
Keep this off, okay? Well, if you're curious, this is Text To Speech. With /tts beginning your message, you can make an automated voice read whatever you typed. *@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@*
# **EMBED LINKS**
If you have this Permission, you can send clickable links, and some sites even show a preview of their site with your message, like YouTube. If you don't have this, you can still send links, but they won't be clickable or show previews.
# **ATTACH FILES**
Enable this if you want to send files to others over your Channel. Clicking will start a download for that item. If you have Discord Nitro, you can upload up to 50MB files. Otherwise, you are stuck with 8MB files.
# **READ MESSAGE HISTORY**
This Permission lets you read messages from before you joined the server. Specifically you. Otherwise, there would be no messages from before you joined.
# **MENTION @EVERYONE**
Yet again, keep this one off. With this Permission, you can mention @everyone like the name says, which is annoying unless it is important.
# **USE EXTERNAL EMOJIS**
With this Permission, you can use Emojis from other servers in the server you are in right now. However, this works with Discord Nitro much better.
# **ADD REACTIONS**
This lets you add *Reactions* to a message. Reactions are like emojis, but dedicated to certain messages. Other people can also react with the same emoji, causing a counter to show up.
# **CONNECT**
This Permission lets you join a Voice Channel. Nothing else said.
# **SPEAK**
This lets you talk in the Voice Channel you may have just joined.
# **MUTE MEMBERS**
This can help with those few annoying people joining your Voice Channel and screaming at the top of their lungs. This lets you Mute Anyone in the Voice Channel.
# **DEAFEN MEMBERS**
This causes people to have a sudden loss of hearing while in the Voice Channel. With this, you can make people not hear anything within the Voice Channel.
# **MOVE MEMBERS**
With this Permission, you can move members in or out of Voice Channels, even if they don't have the proper Permissions to do join themselves. *You cannot force somebody to join a Voice Channel with this. You can only move them when they do.*
# **USE VOICE ACTIVITY**
If you have this Permission, you can use the Voice Activity within your settings to pick up your voice. Without this Permission, you have to use Push-To-Talk.
